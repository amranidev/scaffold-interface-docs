### Generating Many To Many relationship

To generate ManyToMany relationship between tow tables, click on ManyToMany button, choose tables via combobox (table1,table2) then click on create.

Well, this will create a new pivot table schema ready to be migrated adding ManyToMany raltionship methods to models.

> This action doesn't create views, controllers, and routes because we believe that each web artisan has his own unique methodology.
